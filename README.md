# PONG_IOTA
Micropayments PoC

### Info
This is a small side-project of mine. My intention was to show how micropayments can work in a gaming environement. 
If you want to test it without any value payments, just change the payment values in the python.py file. 

This game is tested with Python2.7


### Requirements
```
pip install qrcode
pip install pygame
pip install pyota
```
### How to start
```
git clone https://github.com/MichiKuhl/PONG_IOTA.git
cd pong_iota_v1
python pong.py
```
