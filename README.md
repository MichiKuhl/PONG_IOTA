# PONG_IOTA
Micropayments PoC

### Info
This is a small side-project of mine. It should be a small example of how Microtransactions can work. 
If you want to test it without any value payments, just change the payment values in the python.py file. 

This game is tested with Python2.7


### Requirements
```
pip install qrcode
pip install pygame
pip install pyota
```
### How to start
```
git clone https://github.com/MichiKuhl/PONG_IOTA.git
cd pong_iota_v1
python pong.py
```
